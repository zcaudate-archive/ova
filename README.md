Stateful arrays for clojure

### Huh?

<i>Isn't the whole point of clojure to move to a more functional style of programming using immutable data structures?</i>

Yes. Exactly. Clojure has rid of alot of complexity on the jvm by requiring the programmer to think functionally. However, the issue of shared state is still a problem in multithreaded applications. Clojure has `ref`s and `atom`s to resolve this issue but they tend to be a little basic.

A typical use case of stored state is an atom with a array containing data:

 - Data can be added or removed from the array
 - The data itself can be also changed
 - The data has to be accessible by a number of threads

In the case above, the best option would be to construct a `ref` containing an array of `ref`s containing data. What hara offers is essentially functions that manipulate this structure (which is given the name `ova`).

## ova.core

The main data structure supporting state-based manipulation of records is called an `ova`. Its a useful structure to have as a shared state. I use it as a transactional general purpose store that is the intermediary between the main application, the database and the web presentation layer when there is a need for data to be stored in memory and acted upon in some way by multiple threads.

    (require '[ova.core :as v])

    (def ov (v/ova [{:id 1 :val 1} {:id 2 :val 1} {:id 3 :val 2} {:id 4 :val 2}]))))
